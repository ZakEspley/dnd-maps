# Dungeons & Dragons Map Helper

## Installing

Just clone the repo then run the DaDMapHelper.exe in the site folder. It should open a window in your default browser, hopefully Chrome as you will want to cast one tab.

## Usage

Start by uploading any D&D map image. This should open one additional tab in your browser for a total of two.

The first one is for the Dungeon Master and and it shows the entire map. The second is meant to be cast onto another screen for the players to see. We are casting it to a projector and putting on a table in front of us. That way we can use real dice and minis, but still have a semi interactive map.

The DM can then select areas to show the players by selecting the Rectangle, Ellipse, Polygon, or Brush tool. Right click to use the tool to reveal, and left click to hide if you make a mistake. Whatever the DM selects will be shown in the other tab that you have cast.

To use the Rectangle and Ellipse just click down, drag, and release.

To use the Polygon just click on a starting point, move your mouse and click again to select the end point of the first line. Repeat this until you have built the shape you want, then double click on the last point to finish the shape.

The Brush works for small areas, but is semi-broken. I would only use it if absolutely needed at this point. Just click down and move the mouse to paint the area that you want to use. 

If you need to stop in the middle of a dungeon you can save the game in its current state and restart from there next time.

Make sure to close the command prompt window to end the server when you are done.
